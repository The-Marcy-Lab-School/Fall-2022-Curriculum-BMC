## Code Challenge #1

Given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

`"a"` = `1`, `"b"` = `2`, etc.

**Example:**
```javascript
alphabetPosition("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.");
// "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11"
```
