# Lesson 2: Collaborative Git

## Objectives
Fellows will be able to...
* Understand GitHub as a tool for collaboration and as remote host of git repositories.
* Understand GitHub as a social media platform for career development.
* Create a branch through the Github GUI and the CLI.
* Fork a repository.
* Create a pull request.
* Resolve merge conflicts through the Github GUI and CLI.

## Morning Warmup Questions (Be prepared for one of these questions to be presented at the beginning of lecture)
1. What is the difference between forking, cloning, and branching?
2. Why might a merge conflict happen?

### Optional Learning
So far, we've been working with Git and GitHub to improve our workflow as solo developers. Git(Hub) really shines as a tool for collaborative development. Explore the resources below to learn more about _branching_ and _merging_, the two concepts that GitHub collaborations rests upon.
* [Chapter 3: Git Branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) in Pro Git book.

#### Extend Your Learning
Git branching and merging is one of the most complicated topics to conceptualize. The Coding Train does a pretty good jobs breaking down all sorts of git topics explaining them from the perspective of GUI and CLI.
